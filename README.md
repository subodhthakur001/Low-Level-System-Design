## Introduction

In software engineering, design patterns provide a reusable solution to common problems. This repository focuses on low-level design patterns, which deal with specific object-oriented programming techniques and structures.

## Design Patterns

### Singleton
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

### Factory Method
The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Observer
The Observer pattern allows an object (the subject) to maintain a list of its dependents (observers) and notify them automatically of any state changes.

### Decorator
The Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

### Strategy
The Strategy pattern enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms and encapsulates each one, making them interchangeable.

## Usage

To use the patterns in this repository, simply clone the repository and navigate to the specific pattern folder. Each folder contains the implementation and usage examples.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/low-level-design-patterns.git
cd low-level-design-patterns
